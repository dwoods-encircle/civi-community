This repository now includes **Civi Groups Messenger**, an Expo-powered mobile application that enables authenticated CiviCRM users to message one another inside their shared groups. The app lives in [`mobile/`](./mobile) and ships with:

- Microsoft-backed OAuth sign-in paired with CiviCRM API key, site key, and contact ID validation
- Group browsing and membership-aware messaging with offline caching for recent data
- A modern React Native experience targeting iOS, Android, and the web

Refer to the [mobile README](./mobile/README.md) for full setup, configuration, and usage instructions.
